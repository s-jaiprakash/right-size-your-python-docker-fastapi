Hi everyone,

Here’s a quick overview of my talk on **right-sizing Python Docker and FastAPI**.

We often find that Python scripts run smoothly during local testing, but issues arise when deploying them to production. In this talk, we will explore the common bottlenecks that typically occur, using tools like **cProfile** and **memory profiling** to identify them.

We’ll experiment with ways to enhance performance and test various memory and compute configurations through Docker's capabilities. Beyond just optimizing Python scripts, we’ll also focus on boosting API performance by minimizing latency and maximizing the use of all available CPU cores.

This session will cover tools and methodologies that help optimize Python code to effectively utilize memory and compute resources.

That’s the summary of my talk. Thank you!
